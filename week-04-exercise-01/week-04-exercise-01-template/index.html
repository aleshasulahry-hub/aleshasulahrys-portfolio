        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized- TTU Edition"</h2>
        <p>
            I changed the main headline from "Ready to become a Red Raider?" to "Ready to become the Funniest Student Ever?" I also changed the subheading from "Start your journey to Possible right here." to "End your journey to Possible right here.". For Styles, I made two changes. Firstly, I changed the main heading color from white to a pretty magenta. I also added a text shadow, changing the text shadow of the main heading from black, to a light pink.


        <ul>
            <li>
                I chose the changes that I did because I wanted to see how much of a change my little tweaks could add to the website. It made a huge difference, and made me realize how important editing is. I was able to understand how HTML and CSS interlink through changes I made. I do have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting my own webpages.
